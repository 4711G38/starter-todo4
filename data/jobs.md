## Help wanted!!

I need some help, but first, check out this neat table:

| Name        | Item           | Color  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Jim     | hat | red |
| Bill      | shoe      |   brown |
| Linda | bag     |    chartreuse |

***

And how about this unordered list?
* First item
* Second item

#### Cool, right?

Oh, no. I forgot what I needed help with. Sorry.
